The {partner-product-name} Quick Start helps automate building a baseline architecture that fits within your organization's larger HIPAA-compliance program. Like other AWS compliance architectures, it helps streamline, automate, and implement secure baselines in AWSâ€”from initial design to operational security readiness. It incorporates the expertise of AWS solutions architects, security, and compliance personnel to help you build a secure and reliable architecture through automation.

This Quick Start includes AWS CloudFormation templates, which can be integrated with AWS Service Catalog, to automate building a baseline architecture that fits within your organization's larger HIPAA-compliance program. It also includes a https://fwd.aws/7M7b9?[downloadable security controls matrix^] (Microsoft Excel spreadsheet), which maps HIPAA regulatory requirements to AWS Quick Start implementation. <<matrix-excerpt>> provides an excerpt of the information in that spreadsheet.

You must process, store, and transmit protected health information (PHI) using only HIPAA-eligible AWS services, as defined in the AWS BAA. You may use the full range of AWS services with non-PHI data, even in a HIPAA account under the AWS BAA. For the current list of HIPAA-eligible services, see https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/hipaa-eligible-services-reference/[HIPAA Eligible Services Reference^].
